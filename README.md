# Lisajous's curves
These are the shapes discovered/created by Jules-Antoine Lissajous, a french Physicist in 19th century.
These curves can be interesting to look at, and analize, so i coded a small program to display some, and custom it !

# Usage
To use this program, i used some vars to manipulate the simulation and display:
- circlesnumX : Circles amount on X axis
- circlesnumY : Circles amount on Y axis
- details : Amount of points to draw each shape
- size : Size of shapes and circles
- startspeedX : Start speed on X axis
- startspeedY : Start speed on Y axis
- showspeed : Change vertices color depending on speed of point

This is my first project on Github, there are many more to view now !
